# Software-Engineering-Project
### Thesis Management Website development

In this project we created a fully functional dynamic web-based Dissertation Thesis Management system, developed with the <b>RUP method</b> with the aid of <b>UML diagrams</b>.<br><br>
The website has different functionalities for professors and students. The professors can schedule meetings with their
appointed students, search for specific students, add them to the database if they're not already registered and they're also able to download and grade their
student thesis. The students are able to check their
meetings with their professor , upload their thesis and check it's status and their grade.
<br><br>The website was developed using <b>Html, css, Javascript, C#.NET Core MVC ,</b> and <b>PostgreSQL</b> (5-person project).



## Important:<br>
Before running the application, the user needs to change the password of the database server (file Database.cs method GetConnection()) and set the password of his postgres local server.

Both a professor and a student can login through the same Login Page.
